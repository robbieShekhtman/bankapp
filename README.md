This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

This is a tutorial based web app project with the ultimate goal of helping me learn and become proficient with TypeScript, React, and Next.js. The current state of the project displays a welcome page with a welcome message, a task bar on the side, a panel displaying a singular(not yet linked) bank account, and a counting animation. Upon completion the project should serve as a fully functional banking app with the ability to link multiple bank accounts, transfer funds, view transaction history and more.
